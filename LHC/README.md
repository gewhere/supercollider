# LHC
- The initial development for the classes `LHC.sc`, `FSMDecoder.sc`, and `LHCplayer.sc` is here: `https://github.com/iani/SC/tree/master/Quarks/iz.projects/LHC`, as they have been developed by I. Zannos.

- The folder `11365609` contains the LHC.sc from this repository `https://gist.github.com/yorgosdiapoulis/11365609`.
  - This is my first implementation towards a regular grammar, by performing lexical analysis on the output symbols from `FSMDecoder.sc`.

- The folder `classes` contains all the classes and a demo for the latest version of LHC (with the tokens).

- The `LCH-demo.scd` demonstrates the LHC implemention with the lexical analysis.
## LHCV
- The LHCV.sc is here: `https://github.com/aucotsi/sc3/tree/master/LHC`. Is working with the `LHC.sc` from I. Zannos commit. It needs improvements on the GUI among other things.
