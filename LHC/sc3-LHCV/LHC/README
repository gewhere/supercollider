- This folder contains all up-to-date information for LHC.
- The initial Classes can be found @ 
  https://github.com/iani/SC/tree/master/Quarks/iz.projects/LHC
- There are 4 Classes: 
  	- LHC
	- FSMdecoder
	- LHCplayer
	- LHCV
- The initial class is the LHC.sc and functions as the device demonstrating @ https://vimeo.com/43121821
- LHCV.sc is a simulator class for the other device(*), which includes an analogue parameter for controlling the positive edge clock of the 3-bit counter machine. The class is still under development, but it works as expected.
